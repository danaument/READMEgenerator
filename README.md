### <a name="Description">Description:</a>
This application is a homework assignment for UT's web dev coding bootcamp.  It uses the inquirer.js package to generate a properly formatted readme file in the same file location as the application.  The application can be invoked using the following command: 

```bash
node index.js
```

### <a name="Notes">Notes from Dan:  </a>
This was a very enjoyable project.  I was able to get the main features working rather quickly, so I worked with the inquirer.js documentation to add some features ("validate" and "filter").  I spent about half of my total time figuring out the proper syntax for those features and the regex strings for the validation functions.
